I created an array of objects representing students. Each object have properties of name (string), age (number), and grade (string).
Wrote a function called "filterByGrade" that takes the array and a grade as parameters and returns a new array containing only the students with the matching grade.
Wrote another function called "averageAge" that calculates and returns the average age of the students in the array.
I used loops and array methods of filter, length, and reduce where appropriate.
